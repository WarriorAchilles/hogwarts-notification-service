# Hogwarts Notifications Service

## System Structure

- An API gateway handling requests
- the `retrieveNotifications` lambda queries the database to get the needed notifications
- the `addNotification` lambda adds the notification to the database, and then queues the notification to be sent
- the `notificationQueue` holds all the queued notifications, sending them to be processed by the `processNotification` lambda
- the `processNotification` lambda handles the actual sending of the notification (for the purposes of this project, it just logs that the notification was sent) and then updates the notification in the database to reflect that it has been sent
- the `notifications` database. This is a simple table that holds all the notifications
- the `createDbLambda` function creates the database and `Notifications` table when the project is deployed to AWS

### Tradeoffs and improvements

- Add a DLQ for notifications that fail
- integrate `processNotification` with some service that actually does something with a notification
- Add notifications to a different queue before being added to the database initially, to prevent DB connection pool from being overloaded
- Add another lambda running on a cron job that allows notifications to be scheduled
  - This would involve adding a data field for scheduled time to notifications
  - Is cron job lambda actually the best way to do this? If you have to check every minute that sounds expensive...not sure
- I _think_ I'm guarding against SQL injection properly, but there might be more improvements there.
- The database and API are currently publicly accessible. This made it easier to test, but wouldn't be ideal for a real production environment.
  - Ideally everything would have access within the vpc, preventing external access except where explicitly needed.

## DB Structure

One table: Notifications

Columns:

- id
- recipient
- message
- status
- createdAt

## General Thought Process

Here's a general outline of my thought process as I read the instructions:

- API endpoints, so we'll need an API Gateway
- Each endpoint can trigger a specific lambda
- We'll need a database to hold the notifications
- Instructions mention queueing a message to be sent, and also the "flow of messages", so we should use an SQS queue to hold the messages before they're sent.
- Another lambda can process/"send" the notifications and grab them from the queue.

## Setup instructions

This project was made with Node 22.18.0

1. In the root of the project, run

   ```
   npm i
   ```

2. Then in the `/src` directory, run

   ```
   npm i
   ```

   This ensures the dependencies necessary for the code inside the lambdas are included, as well as the dependencies needed to deploy the project to AWS.

This project uses the AWS CDK to automate deployment and creation of all resources.

See the [AWS CDK docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/getting-started.html) for more info on installing and configuring the CDK CLI itself.

3. Once you have the cdk cli configured, only two commands are needed to deploy the project to AWS. Build scripts have been configured to streamline the process:

   ```
   npm run build
   npm run deploy
   ```

   **NOTE:** It make take 5-10 minutes to deploy everything.

   Once deployed, the API url will be displayed among the resource URLs in the console. It should look something similar to:

   ```
   HogwartsNotificationServiceStack.MyApiGatewayEndpoint84AE9DBF = https://93y3815dv7.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/prod/
   ```

   You can use this URL to make requests to the API

When finished testing or developing, run the following command to tear down the resources:

```
cdk destroy
```

**WARNING**: This will also destroy the database, and any data in it will be lost.

## Example requests/responses

**NOTE:** All requests must have the `X-API-Key` header. The static api key defined for the purpose of testing this project is `harryPotterAndTheSorcerersStone`

### POST /notifications

Example request:

```json
{
  "recipient": "Hermoine Granger",
  "message": "Reminder: Potions homework due tomorrow"
}
```

Example response:

```json
Successfully queued notification!
```

### GET /notifications/{recipient}

Optional querystring param: `limit`. Limits the number of returned items.

Example response:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "3b12f1df-5232-4804-897e-917bf397618a",
    "recipient": "Harry Potter",
    "message": "Did you put your name in the goblet of fire??!?!?",
    "status": "delivered",
    "createdAt": "2025-10-02T12:34:56Z"
  },
  {
    "id": "4a12f2ed-7890-1234-877f-263jb583729b",
    "recipient": "Harry Potter",
    "message": "Lunch has been delayed to 1:30pm",
    "status": "queued",
    "createdAt": "2025-11-02T12:34:56Z"
  }
]
```

## Other stuff

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute the app.

## Useful commands

- `npm run build` compile typescript to js
- `npm run watch` watch for changes and compile
- `npm run test` perform the jest unit tests
- `npx cdk deploy` deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
- `npx cdk diff` compare deployed stack with current state
- `npx cdk synth` emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
